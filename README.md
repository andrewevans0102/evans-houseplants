# evans-houseplants

![flowers](/public/hero.jpeg)

This site tracks how the Evans houseplants are doing.

It uses:

-   [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
-   [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
-   [ReactMarkdown](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown)

To create posts for the site:

1. you add a markdown file to the `_posts` folder
2. you add a cover image to the `public` folder and reference it in your markdown

The site has posts that appear on the homepage, and then an "About" page that lists all of the plants we have this year.

To run the site locally just do:
`npm run dev`
